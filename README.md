# React Native Web Screen

React Native Web Screen is an open source library that can bring your web application into the [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) world. It allows you to render web pages as if they were native iOS or Android screens. It supports caching and provides native navigation animations resulting in mobile-like user experience. You can easily move your entire web app, or embed a few screens that pretend to be native, without reimplementing them in React Native.
